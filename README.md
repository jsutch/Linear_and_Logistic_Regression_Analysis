# Linear and Logistic Regression Analysis

Some examples of Linear and Logistic Regression Analysis using scikit-learn and tensorflow. 

- Analyzing click effectiveness of Advertising Data in a web app (Logistic Regression)  
Working with a fake advertising data set that indicates whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement, we will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

- Titanic Dataset Analysis (Logistic Regression)
This is mostly a demonstration of cleaning up data to prepare it for a Logistic Regression and preparing a confusion matrix. 

- Comparing Housing Costs (Linear Regression)
Analyzing the 1970s Boston Housing dataset in scikit-learn

- Mobile App Analysis (Linear Regression)  
The scenario is this: an eCommerce company sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
